No matter what you are interested in(making games, projects, website building, even writing your first hello world) the Linux terminal is a much more efficient way to complete your projects. u are on Mac/Linux but most of us probably have a windows machine at school or at home. Instead of buying a new machine or installing a new OS, luckily Windows actually comes with a Linux subsystem called WSL.
	
Why should you use WSL instead of  Linux? Firstly WSL is a pre-installed application that is already on your computer. For most other WSL alternatives, installing a completely new operating system is required to run. 

WSL vs Bash 	
WSL is an implementation of Linux system calls on the Windows NT kernel, which allows you to run Linux executables unmodified (like Wine does for Ubuntu). "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" is just one application of WSL.
What you can do on WSL?
WSL is an easy way to be introduced to Linux and  Linux software.
A nagging problem with desktop Linux is hardware support, especially on laptops. WSL obviates this problem. Most PCs on the market are still sold with Windows preinstalled. Just download and install WSL and you have an instant Linux desktop. In the future, "Linux on the desktop" could mean just installing WSL and a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store instead of a standalone operating system.   WSL is also easier than a dual boot or Virtual Machine Since WSL already runs in Windows, you don't have to reboot or launch a VM. With dual booting, you have to make hard drive space when installing the system and make sure you have backup media to boot from in case something goes wrong. If you want to run something in Linux from Windows and vice versa, you have to restart your system.
